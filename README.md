# Coins
Very small first rust project using an enum and based off of one of the examples in the rust book.

This program generates five random coins between Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quater.

Cent Values:<br />
Penny -> 1<br />
Nickel -> 5<br />
Dime -> 10<br />
Quater -> 25<br />

After the five coins has been generated the program then adds all their cent values together and returns the total.
